## Claude-Specific Instructions

- Do not write any code until all changes have been listed and explicitly approved
- Prefer Edit over Write for existing files
- Never commit or push without an explicit request
- When multiple independent changes are needed, do them in parallel tool calls
- Keep solutions minimal — no extra comments, docstrings, or refactors beyond what was asked
